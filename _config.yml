intro: >
   Throughout my years of studying communications engineering in Egypt and in Germany, I have demonstrated a good level of academic achievement and have shown a particular strength in software and hardware development.
   I have been consistently engaged in projects, most of which involved designing and implementations.
   For my research project in my master studies, it was at ComNets institute, I developed a power saving technique for 5G mobile network where I had to conduct a lot of simulations and data analysis in Object-Oriented Programming with Matlab.
   In addition to my academic background, I have experience working on various real-world projects where I have acquired practical skills in PCB designing, Hardwares, Sensors, Embedded Systems C/C++ programming and Scripting RPis.
   if not all, it also made a significant improvement in my non-cognitive skills such as time management, teamwork and communication with a diverse group of people.
